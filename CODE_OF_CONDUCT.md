# Code of Conduct

This is a **code of conduct for EpycSolutions technical spaces**. It applies both within physical spaces, such as EpycSolutions 
technical events and EpycSolutions technical presentations in other events, and virtual spaces ([SkyFam](https://github.com/SkyFamDE),
[SapphireElysium](https://github.com/SapphireElysium), and other development-oriented spaces operated by EpycSolutions).


## Principles

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we are committed to making participation in EpycSolutions technical projects
a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation,
disability, neuroatypicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, political affiliation, or religion.

Technical skills and community status make no difference to the right to be respected and the obligation to respect others. Newcomers and
other contributors with limited experience in our community deserve a welcoming attitude and constructive feedback. Prolific contributions 
and technical expertise are not a justification for lower standards of behavior.


## Unacceptable behavior

Harassment and other types of inappropriate behavior are unacceptable in all public and private EpycSolutions technical spaces.
Examples include but are not limited to:

- Personal attacks, violence, threats of violence, threats of legal action, or deliberate intimidation
- Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments
- Gratuitous or off-topic use of sexual language or imagery
- Inappropriate or unwanted attention, touching, or physical contact (sexual or otherwise)
- Inappropriate or unwanted public or private communication, following, or any form of stalking
- Unwanted photography or recording
- Disclosure of a person's identity or other private information without their consent. Disclosure of some identifying information is not
  consent to disclose other identifying information
- Inappropriate or unwanted publication or private communication. Publishing or reporting private communication or personally identifying
  information for the purposes of reporting harassment (as explained here) and/or in the case of whistleblowing, is acceptable
- Harming the discussion or community with methods such as sustained disruption, interruption, or blocking of community collaboration
  (i.e. trolling)
- Discrimination, particularly against marginalised and otherwise underrepresented groups. Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and
  encouraged
- Using the code of conduct system for purposes other than reporting genuine violations of the code of conduct (e.g., retaliating against
  a reporter or victim by filing a report claiming their response was harassment)
- Attempting to circumvent a decision of the [Committee](/CoC/Committee.md), e.g. unblocking someone during a period the Committee banned them


## Report a problem

***In case of threats of harm and other urgent situations**, notify the relevant authorities first (if possible) and 
[email](mailto:david.thomas.stuewe@gmail.com) *¹ me (David).*

People who experience or observe unacceptable behavior are encouraged to follow any of these steps:
1. Ask the person who is behaving unacceptably to stop. Make them aware of this Code of Conduct
2. If you are at an event, report the problem to the event organisers *², or a designated contact
3. Report the problem directly to the [Code of Conduct Committee](/CoC/Committee.md) via the [Discord](https://discord.gg/hWhcQ5T). You can also
   send a report to the Committee if you reported an incident elsewhere but were not satisfied with the response


Reports can be as short as a notification with a link, but more information will help us understand what is happening. You can include:

- Your contact information (e.g. EpycSolutions and EinsWurmi usernames), if you want to identify yourself
- Your account of the incident:
    - Where and when it happened
    - A description of the unacceptable behavior
    - Who was involved and who saw it happen
    - Whether the incident is ongoing
- Any additional information that will help us fully understand the problem, such as previous incidents or special circumstances
- Links to public records of the incident, if any
- Screenshots showing what exactly happened

Reports are processed confidentially. For more information, see [Committee](/CoC/Committee.md).

Go to [Cases](/CoC/Cases.md) to learn about how reports to the Committee are processed.
