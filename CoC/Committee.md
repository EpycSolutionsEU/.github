# Code of Conduct Committee

The Code of Conduct Committee is responsible for handling reports of violations of the [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensuring that our community remains a respectful and harassment-free environment for everyone.

## Committee Composition

The Committee consists of 3-5 members from the EpycSolutions community who are:

- Trusted members with a history of positive contributions
- Committed to maintaining a safe and inclusive environment
- Able to handle sensitive information with discretion and confidentiality
- Capable of making fair and unbiased decisions

Committee members serve for a term of one year, with the possibility of renewal. To ensure continuity, terms are staggered so that not all members rotate out at the same time.

## Committee Responsibilities

The Committee is responsible for:

1. **Receiving and reviewing reports** of Code of Conduct violations
2. **Investigating incidents** by gathering information from all parties involved
3. **Making decisions** about appropriate responses to violations
4. **Implementing consequences** when violations are confirmed
5. **Communicating with reporters and reported individuals** throughout the process
6. **Maintaining confidentiality** of all parties involved
7. **Documenting cases** for internal reference and continuity
8. **Reviewing and updating** the Code of Conduct and related processes as needed

## Recusal

Committee members must recuse themselves from handling a report if:

- They are directly involved in the incident
- They have a close personal or professional relationship with any of the involved parties
- They feel they cannot be impartial for any reason

In cases where multiple members must recuse themselves, temporary members may be appointed to ensure fair handling of the report.
