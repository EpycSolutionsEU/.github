# Code of Conduct Cases

This document outlines how the Code of Conduct Committee processes reports of potential violations and the procedures followed to ensure fair and consistent handling of all cases.

## Reporting Process

Reports can be submitted through:
- Discord private messages to Committee members
- In-person reports to designated contacts at events

All reports are treated confidentially, and the privacy of all parties involved is respected throughout the process.

## Case Handling Procedure

### 1. Initial Receipt and Assessment

When a report is received:
- The Committee acknowledges receipt within 24 hours
- An initial assessment is conducted to determine if the report falls within the scope of the Code of Conduct
- If immediate action is required (e.g., ongoing harassment at an event), the Committee will take appropriate steps to ensure safety

### 2. Investigation

The Committee will:
- Gather information from the reporter, the reported person, and any witnesses
- Review any available evidence (screenshots, public communications, etc.)
- Document all findings while maintaining confidentiality
- Consult with other Committee members to ensure fair assessment

The investigation process typically takes 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the case.

### 3. Decision Making

After investigation, the Committee will:
- Determine if a violation of the Code of Conduct has occurred
- Decide on appropriate consequences if a violation is confirmed
- Reach decisions by consensus whenever possible, or by majority vote if necessary

### 4. Consequences

Possible consequences for Code of Conduct violations include:

- **Warning**: A private, written notice explaining the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate
- **Temporary Ban**: Removal from EpycSolutions spaces (online or in-person) for a specified time period
- **Permanent Ban**: Indefinite removal from all EpycSolutions spaces
- **Public Statement**: In cases where a public response is deemed necessary
- **Other Actions**: Such as requiring an apology, mediation, or educational measures

The severity of consequences will be proportional to the violation and will take into account factors such as:
- The nature and severity of the violation
- Whether it is a first-time or repeated offense
- The impact on affected individuals and the community
- The response of the reported person when informed of the issue

### 5. Communication of Outcome

The Committee will:
- Inform the reporter and the reported person of the decision and any consequences
- Provide a summary of the reasoning behind the decision
- Respect the privacy of all parties in any public statements

## Appeals Process

If either the reporter or the reported person believes the decision was unfair or the process was not followed correctly, they may appeal within 14 days of being notified of the outcome.

Appeals should:
- Be submitted in writing to the Committee
- Clearly state the grounds for appeal
- Provide any additional information relevant to the appeal

Appeals will be reviewed by Committee members who were not directly involved in the original decision whenever possible.

## Documentation and Record Keeping

The Committee maintains confidential records of all reports and their resolutions for:
- Tracking patterns of behavior
- Ensuring consistent application of the Code of Conduct
- Handling potential repeated violations

All records are stored securely and access is limited to current Committee members.

## Continuous Improvement

The Committee regularly reviews the handling of cases to:
- Identify areas for improvement in the process
- Update the Code of Conduct and related documents as needed
- Develop preventative measures and educational resources
